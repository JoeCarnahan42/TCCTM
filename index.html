          My name is Joseph Carnahan, but I usually go by Joe. I am a
          machinist/mechanic turned software engineer. I have worked in the
          industrial field for 5 years, and I am now changing careers. My
          journey started in high school when I was first exposed to the trades.
          As a kid who knew nothing about what he wanted to do(but a lot about
          football), the small amount of schooling was appealing. After school,
          I ended up as an apprentice toolmaker, polishing die parts for more
          experienced toolmakers. Shortly after starting this position, covid-19
          really took over the country and the company restructured and changed
          their priorities, causing toolmakers to be unnecessary. The company
          switched their main priority to automation, where I began learning how
          to build complex custom automated machinerey.
          <a href="builds.html">Here</a> you can find some of my builds!
          Currently, I am a freelance software engineer participating in the
          online bootcamp Parsity. Here, I am learning full-stack development
          and honing my coding skills as a software engineer. At the moment, I
          am currently seeking a role as a "Junior Software Engineer".
