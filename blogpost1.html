        <h1><u>The Month of September, so far....</u></h1>
        <h3>September 19, 2024</h3>
        <p>Hey everyone, and welcome to the first blog post of my experimental website. I don't have much to talk about as far as programing so I'm just going to discuss the roller coaster that has been the month of September. It really all started at the end of August, with our <strong>only good car</strong> breaking down. As we all know, when it rains, it pours. This event was followed up with my wife Carli being injured at her place of work. To top it all off, right after labor day, I was let go from my machinist job.</p>
        <p>I'll start with the car. For a long while we have had 2 cars. One of them, a poorly running VW Jetta that I used for my very short commute to work. This vehicle is currently unfit for the highway. The other vehicle was a Chevy Trailblazer that my wife used to commute to work in St.Louis. Naturally, driving the SUV back and forth from St.Louis daily was quite taxing for the vehicle. Short story long, the entire front end suspension of the vehicle was shot and we could not afford to fix it, or buy a new car with cash. While waiting for a loan to buy ourselves a used car, my brother Matthew loaned us his vehicle until we got ours. During this time, Carli was injured at work, and was unable to earn a full paycheck. Also during this time, she needed someone at home with her to take care of her while she recovered. This leads me to the big one.</p>
        <p>While taking care of Carli, I was forced to miss a few days of work. Upon my return, just after labor day, I was immediately let go from my employment. Now I wont lie to you, I did have some attendance issues in the past(on account of me completely losing my drive and love for my craft). However, I fully expected these recent absences to be excused, based on the nature of the circumstance. As you already know, this was not the case.</p>
        <h4><u>Looking at the positive, and moving forward</u></h4>
        <p>Obviously, this <strong>sucks</strong>. But here is the good news. Since about early July/August, I discovered a wonderful trade that has captivated me in ways I could have never imagined. "Software Engineering". Since then, I began self teaching myself the absolute basics, and then taking the <a href="https://dev30.xyz/" target="_blank"><u>Dev30</u></a> JavaScript course. After completion of Dev30, I decided to take on the larger bootcamp called <a href="https://parsity.io/" target="_blank"><u>Parsity</u></a>. Since being fired, I have commited a substantial amount more time to learning this craft with the ultimate goal of career changing. I would love to be able to say I have sucessfully changed career by <strong>this time next year</strong>. </p>
        <h4><u>Other notable events</u></h4>
        <p>In other, less serious news, sports! My roller hockey league, the <a href="https://www.gatewayrollerhockey.com/" target="_blank"><u>GRHL</u></a> has started back up, and we played our first game on the 14th of this month. My team, the <a href="https://www.gatewayrollerhockey.com/teams/wolves" target="_blank"><u>Wolves</u></a> won our game against the <a href="https://www.gatewayrollerhockey.com/teams/outlaws" target="_blank"><u>Outlaws</u></a>. This was a much anticipated matchup, since the Outlaws eleminated us from the playoffs last year, and ended up winning the Gateway Cup. We(the Wolves) were favorites to win the whole thing at the start of the year.</p>

        <p>Other than the GRHL, the NHL season is starting soon as well. Personally, I am foaming at the mouth for some hockey. So much so, that I bought pre-season tickets to the Blackhawks @ Blues game coming up on the 28th.</p>

        <h4><u>Thank you for reading...</u></h4>
        <p>If you made it this far, I sincerely thank you. This is hopefully the first of many posts, and I hope this was a decent intro to myself and how things are starting off as this site launches. Hope to see you back, and have an awesome rest of your day.</p>
